This is some notes when I learn MIT6.092.
Course page:https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-092-introduction-to-programming-in-java-january-iap-2010/

You can find all the resources to take this course in the website.

Assignments1: Computes an object will fall in Earth's gravity.

Assignments2: To calculate pay for hourly employees.

Assignment4的代码目前没有考虑重复放入相同名称的书籍的问题，而且for循环写的有点多，效率不高。
